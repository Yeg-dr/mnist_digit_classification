# Digit Classification with CNN on MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST datsset using PyTorch. As my first serious project  in deeplearning, it demonstrates my ability to build, train, and evaluate a neural network for image classification, achieving ~99.06% accuracy on the test set. I used AI tools to streamline debugging and optimize project workflow.
