# Handwritten Digit Classification with CNN on MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. As my first serious project in deep learning, it demonstrates my ability to build, train, and evaluate a neural network for image classification, achieving ~98-99% accuracy on the test set. I used an AI assistant for guidance on project structure and debugging to streamline the development process.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset with PyTorch.
- Implements a CNN with two convolutional layers, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
- Visualizes training/test loss and accuracy over epochs.
- Displays sample predictions with true and predicted labels.
- Includes error analysis to explore misclassified digits.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV

## Installation
To run this project, install the required libraries:
```bash
